# Web Scraper
A simple web scraper built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fspromiseswritefilefile-data-options) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)

`quotesScraper.js` uses [http://quotes.toscrape.com/](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) as a learning experience

`pokeScraper.js` uses [https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/gen1pokemon.shtml](https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/gen1pokemon.shtml) to grab all data associated with the first 151 Pok√©mon that I'd like to use for a CRUD project. I wanted this data to build my own API
